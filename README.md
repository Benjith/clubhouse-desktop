I know source code is a mess, but since it's been developed in a hurry ( about 30-40hrs ) to get it working and also since it was my first time using Electron, Vue, and Agora, i put my time into adding new features and improving stability instead of a clean code. So if you think it's a mess, feel free to make it clean and do a pull request.
Also i'm using a really old version of Agora web SDK and that's because new version of Agora won't work because of the limitation they put on the user agents for clubhouse ( at least i think so ).
