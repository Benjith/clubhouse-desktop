# clubhouse-desktop

This is an unofficial desktop client for the currently trending ClubHouse.

Currently only mac version is available. I'll maybe build it for other platforms in the future ( maybe not! ).
Developed Using Electron JS + Vue JS + AgoraSDK.
Also this is my first ever try at electron, vue, and agora. So if you've decompiled it and somehow accessed the source code, have that in mind plus the fact that i developed it in only 14 hours.

For downloading the Mac/Linux/Windows compiled version go to releases section.

I know source code is a mess, but since it's been developed in a hurry to get it working and also since it was my first time using Electron, Vue, and Agora, i put my time into adding new features and improving stability instead of a clean code. So if you think it's a mess, feel free to make it clean and do a pull request.
Also i'm using a really old version of Agora web SDK and that's because new version of Agora won't work because of the limitation they put on the user agents for clubhouse ( at least i think so ).
