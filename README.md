# clubhouse-desktop

This is an unofficial desktop client for the currently trending ClubHouse.

# Any bans on the accounts is possible so use it at your own risk!

Currently only mac version is available. I'll maybe build it for other platforms in the future ( maybe not! ).
Developed Using Electron JS + Vue JS + AgoraSDK.
Also this is my first ever try at electron, vue, and agora. So if you've decompiled it and somehow accessed the source code, have that in mind plus the fact that i developed it in only 14 hours.

For downloading the Mac/Linux version go to releases section.
